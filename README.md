<NOTE> If you fork and clone any GitHub links from Stripe branch, you must remember to set the publishableKey in stripe-button.component.jsx to your own publishable_key value in your stripe dashboard. This key allows stripe to know that requests from any stripe checkout components are connected to your stripe account! You can find the key under the Developers Tab, and then the API keys tab in the menu that opens!
